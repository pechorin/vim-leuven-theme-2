* Leuven Theme for Vim 2

This is fork of [[https://github.com/gzagatti/vim-leuven-theme][https://github.com/gzagatti/vim-leuven-theme]] with two changes:

- `Type` color changed from black foreground to `LeuvenLightBlueBg` (primarly for better ruby class names highlight)
- `@symbol` added (with `LeuvenDarkMagenta` value) for ruby symbols highlight

The awesome [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][Emacs color theme]] on white background --- now on Vim.
